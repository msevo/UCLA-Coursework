# Bugs!
This program was built using C++ in Xcode.
One "field.txt" file and up to four "*.bug" files need to be passed as arguments for this program to be executed.

The development of this game was an exercise in creating clear, logical class hierarchies, as well as in determining the best data structure for each specific purpose.

I wrote Actor.h, Actor.cpp, StudentWorld.h, Studentworld.cpp, TestAnt.bug, and report.txt, while the professor provided the rest of the files.
