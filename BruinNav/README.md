This program finds the shortest possible route between two locations in the Westwood area around UCLA using the A* algorithm.

I wrote AttractionMapperImpl, MapLoaderImpl, MyMap, NavigatorImpl, SegmentMapperImpl, support.cpp, support.h, and report.txt, while the professor provided the rest of the files.

Valid locations to navigate between are located in the validlocs.txt.
