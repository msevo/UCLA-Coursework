MyMap)
associate(): If MyMap holds N associations, then associate() is O(log N).
find(): If MyMap holds N associations, then find() is O(log N).

AttractionMapper)
init(): If MapLoader holds N street segments and there are A total attractions, then init() is O(N + (Alog A)).
getGeoCoord(): If AttractionMapper holds N associations, then getGeoCoord() is O(log N).

SegmentMapper)
init(): If MapLoader holds N street segments and there are A total attractions, then init() is O((N+A)log(N+A)).
getSegments(): If SegmentMapper holds N associations, then getSegments() is O(log N).

Navigator)
navigate(): If V is the total number of GeoCoords visited, G is the total number of GeoCoords in SegmentMapper, and A is the average number of attractions associated with each GeoCoord visited, then navigate() is O(V(log(G)+log(V)+A)).
